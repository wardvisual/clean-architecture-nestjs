# Clean Architecture

## Read

NestJS is a framework for building efficient, scalable Node.js server-side applications. It uses modern JavaScript, is built with TypeScript (it's a strict syntactical superset of JavaScript), and combines elements of OOP (Object Oriented Programming), FP (Functional Programming), and FRP (Functional Reactive Programming).

One of the key principles of NestJS is to use a modular architecture, which allows developers to organize their code into cohesive modules. This helps to improve the maintainability and scalability of the application, as it allows developers to focus on specific areas of the codebase without affecting other parts of the application.

This repository uses NestJS to implement a clean architecture, which is a software design pattern that separates the concerns of the application into distinct layers. This allows for a clear separation of responsibilities within the codebase, making it easier to understand and maintain.

It's important to note that this repository is still under development, which means that it is not yet complete and may contain bugs or unfinished features.
